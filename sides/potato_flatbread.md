# Traditional Finnish Potato Flatbread - Perunarieska

2 cups of potato mash (mashed potatoes, 50g butter, a splash of milk, salt)  
2 cups of barley flour  
2 eggs  
salt  

Heat oven to 250C.

Mix all ingredients together until well incorporated, but don't overmix to avoid the dough becoming tough. Definitely don't knead. Taste to check you have added enough salt.

Flour the work surface lightly and divide the dough into 4 balls. Flatten each ball into a half an inch or slightly thinner circle. Place on a baking sheet covered with non-stick baking paper and prick with a fork.

Place in a preheated oven and bake for about 15 minutes (or a bit longer if your breads are not very thin) until the breads have got some nice colour. Wrap in a clean tea towel and serve immediately with butter.
